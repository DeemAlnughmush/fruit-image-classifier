#  Fruit Image Classifier with Teachable Machine

This project demonstrates how to train an image classification model using [Teachable Machine by Google](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).  
The model distinguishes between **grape**, **strawberry**, and **blueberry** images.

##  Model Info

- Trained on: **Teachable Machine**
- Exported as: **TensorFlow ‚Üí Keras**
- Classes:
  - üçá Grape
  - üçì Strawberry
  - ü´ê Blueberry

---

##  How It Works

A Python script running in **Google Colab**:
- Loads the trained model (`keras_model.h5`)
- Loads the class names from `labels.txt`
- Accepts a test image from the user
- Preprocesses the image to match the model input
- Predicts the fruit type and shows the **confidence percentage**
